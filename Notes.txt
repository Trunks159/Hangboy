Your errors rn will only come from the third window's button text, trying to make it
determine the hangman word on press of the button.

Error is on line 78 of kivy code

Spent seemingly all day trying to get the kivy file to access my hangman 
word from python. 
In the end i had to create a new class that made an instance of the hangman class in my
hangman1.py python file, and access that value from the current window 
with root.hangman. Needed to use StringProperty.
Also fixed transitions.
Toook me forever to implement the letter implementatation function:
	hangman = ObjectProperty(IDK.x.selecting_hangman())
	def btn(self):
		blank_rep = IDK.x.letter_representation(self.hangman)
		print(blank_rep)

so that was fun.

8:31pm
Trying my best to implement test_guessed_letter, trying to figure out the parameters.
Trying to add widgets when buttons are pressed, not going well

5/15/19
Made great progress today. Learned to affect widgets dynamically (by removing them, updating text)
Implemented nitty gritty successfully!
Just have to clean most things up, have hangman pic appear, parameters on 
when game restarts/ends/loses/wins

Most of the heavy duty code is here though
